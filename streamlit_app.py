        The challenge of effectively deterring geese in various environments has been a persistent issue. This paper introduces a novel solution: the Robot Laser Goose, a system that leverages deep learning for target recognition and operates within a **500m range**. The system utilizes a combination of RGB-D camera and radar sensor modalities, similar to previous studies on object interception. However, our focus is on the identification and deterrence of geese, achieving a remarkable **95% success rate**. The Robot Laser Goose employs artificial neural networks for both geese detection and deterrence strategy prediction. The system's robustness and adaptability are demonstrated through its ability to operate in diverse environments and conditions. Furthermore, the Robot Laser Goose outperforms traditional methods in terms of range, accuracy, and success rate. This research contributes to the broader field of robotics and wildlife management, providing a scalable and efficient solution for geese deterrence. The findings also open up new avenues for the application of **deep learning** in wildlife interaction and management.

            This paper presents a novel approach to image compression using **Variational Autoencoders** in Neural Networks, achieving a significant **10% improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** over traditional JPEG methods. The focus of this research is on **low bit rate** image compression, a critical area in the field of image processing and transmission. The proposed method leverages the power of neural networks to optimize the compression process, resulting in superior image quality and reduced data size. The paper also explores the trade-offs between compression rate, image quality, and computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms JPEG in terms of PSNR but also maintains a comparable computational efficiency. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve image compression techniques, particularly in the context of neural networks, and has potential implications for a wide range of applications, from web image optimization to high-resolution image transmission in resource-constrained environments. The findings of this study pave the way for further research into the application of neural networks in image compression and other related fields.
